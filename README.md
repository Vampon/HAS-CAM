## CamSim

CamSim is a simulation environment designed for PTZ cameras based on the Unity3D engine, mainly aimed at solving the problems of high training costs and difficult scene reproduction of reinforcement learning in practical hardware platforms. The platform supports simulation control operations, parameter customization, dynamic environment change simulation, and other functions for detectors. It can communicate and interact with the algorithm end, providing a reliable experimental verification environment for the design, training, and performance evaluation of reinforcement learning algorithms.
